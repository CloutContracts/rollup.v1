# Coming soon!

Currently we are planning on potentially integrating the [OPRHub protocol](https://thehubbleproject.github.io/docs/)

**To-do:** \
Rename --> TestToken.sol to Token.sol \
Add runtime instructions and interfacing software \
Change all the files that import it as TestToken.sol \
Add the ERC20 details to the Token.sol (symbol, supply, etc.)
